If these organizations had adopted larger team sizes, the larger monolithic systems that would have emerged would not have given them the same ability to experiment, adapt, and ultimately keep their customers happy.

	"content": "Welcome! Welcome to our little slice of Internet nirvana where the DevOps patterns flow like wine and, hopefully\u0026hellip; are just as useful .\nSo what is DevOps?  DevOps integrates developers and operations teams in order to improve collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, automating workflows and continuously measuring application performance.\n This is a very straightforward definition that belittles the complexity involved with bringing developers and operations teams together to release software. Fundamentally these two groups have differing objectives which often lead to conflict. Developers want to release software features and are often incentivized in that regard. Operations teams, however, strive for goals like uptime and will often have service level agreements (SLAs) that limit their incentive to make changes to production software. The clash between these differing incentives is often difficult to assuage.\nOften you\u0026rsquo;ll hear DevOps compared with a 3-legged stool. Each leg representing a fundamental part of a successful devops transformation. These 3 parts are PEOPLE, PROCESS and TOOLING. In order to achieve high-performance in software delivery all 3 of these components require attention to help align an organization around delivering software efficiently to end customers.\nWhy is this site useful? Over the course of a decade we\u0026rsquo;ve worked with customers of all shapes and sizes to implement DevOps tooling and processes. During that time we\u0026rsquo;ve seen things done really well\u0026hellip; and also very poorly. This site tries to organize some of the better things we\u0026rsquo;ve seen into reusable patterns that companies can use to help with their adoption of DevOps.\nOrganization This site is organized into 7 categories of patterns related to DevOps. Why 7? Basically, we had to draw the line somewhere and at some point felt like we were just overanalyzing. We could have categorized things into people, process, tooling and then had several categories under each of those but we choose a simpler route of just having 7 buckets that we use to organize our patterns. Whether the pattern is related to people, process or tooling you\u0026rsquo;ll find it under the following 7 categories:\n Plan Development Build Deploy Test Release Operate  "
