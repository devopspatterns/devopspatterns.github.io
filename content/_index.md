# Welcome!

Welcome to our little slice of Internet nirvana where the DevOps patterns flow like
wine and, hopefully... are just as useful <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>.


## So what is DevOps?

> DevOps integrates developers and operations teams in order to improve
collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, automating
workflows and continuously measuring application performance.

This is a very straightforward definition that belittles the complexity
involved with bringing developers and operations teams together to release
software.  Fundamentally these two groups have differing objectives which often lead
to conflict.  Developers want to release software features and are often
incentivized in that regard.  Operations teams, however, strive for
goals like uptime and will often have service level agreements (SLAs) that
limit their incentive to make changes to production software.  The clash between
these differing incentives is often difficult to assuage.

Often you'll hear DevOps compared with a 3-legged stool.  Each leg representing a
fundamental part of a successful devops transformation.  These 3 parts are PEOPLE, PROCESS and
TOOLING.  In order to achieve high-performance in software delivery all 3 of these
components require attention to help align an organization around
delivering software efficiently to end customers.

## Why is this site useful?
Over the course of a decade we've worked with customers of all shapes and sizes
to implement DevOps tooling and processes.  During that time we've seen things
done really well and also really poorly.  This site tries to organize some of the
better things we've seen into reusable patterns that companies can use to help
with their adoption of DevOps.

## Organization
This site is organized into 7 categories of patterns related to DevOps.  Why 7?
Basically, we had to draw the line somewhere.  We could have categorized things
into people, process, tooling and then had several categories under each of
those but we choose a simpler route of just having 7 buckets that we use to
organize our patterns.  Whether the pattern is related to people, process or
tooling you'll find it under the following 7 categories:

* [Plan](/plan)
* [Development](/development)
* [Build](/build)
* [Deploy](/deploy)
* [Test](/test)
* [Release](/release)
* [Operate](/operate)
