# Welcome!

Welcome to our little slice of Internet nirvana where the DevOps patterns flow like
wine and, hopefully... are just as useful ;)

## So what is DevOps?

> DevOps integrates developers and operations teams in order to improve
collaboration and productivity by automating infrastructure, automating
workflows and continuously measuring application performance.

## Why is this site useful?
Over the course of a decade we've worked with customers of all shapes and sizes
to implement DevOps tooling and processes.  During that time we've seen things
done really well and really poorly.  This site tries to organize some of the
better things we've seen into reusable patterns that companies can use to help
with their adoption of DevOps.

## Organization
This site is organized into 7 categories of patterns related to DevOps.  Why 7?
Basically, we had to draw the line somewhere.  We could have categoried things
into people, process, tooling and then had several categories under each of
those but we choose a simpler route of just having 7 buckets that we use to
organize our patterns.  Whether the pattern is related to people, process or
tooling you'll find it under the following 7 categories:

* [Plan](/plan)
* Development
* Build
* Deploy
* Test
* Release
* Operate
