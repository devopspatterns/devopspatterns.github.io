1.  This is a microservices design pattern, but is it really necessary for
    DevOps
1.  Teams are able to self-organize and select their own tooling
1.  Programming language, development tooling, build services, etc should be
    team selected for efficiency
1.  Teams should be multi-functional
1.  Data should not be shared across projects
1.  Data sharing should go through the service itself
1.  Projects can choose type of database (SQL, NoSQL, Graph, etc) or specific database
    software (MySQL vs MongoDB)
1. These services with their independent concerns can change and evolve
separately from one another, resulting in the ability to deliver changes to
production faster. If these organizations had adopted larger team sizes, the
larger monolithic systems that would have emerged would not have given them the
same ability to experiment, adapt, and ultimately keep their customers happy.
